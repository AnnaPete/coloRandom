# Abstract:
We built a web application that will generate a random palette of colors that can then be saved in the DOM.  Users may also lock individual color cards to retain those colors and then generate random colors for the remaining cards, again, with the option to save the palette. The application provides the user this ability by generating random hexadecimal color codes (unless the respective card is locked by the user) and passing them into display cards. The saved palettes are saved in a separate section. Once saved, they can also be deleted from the DOM by clicking the trash can beside the saved palette.

# Preview of App:
Below you can see the functionality of the app as we lock the first 3 colors then generate new colors for the last 2 and save the palette.

# Context:
Working as a group of four peers during our 4th week of Mod1 classes at Turing, we invested 25 hours collectively to create this application's functionality from scratch using HTML,CSS, and Javascript.

# Learning Goals:
- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Refine your collaboration skills

# Tech Used
- GitHub
- Terminal
- VS Code
- Chrome Browser/Dev tools
- Zoom
- Slack

# Wins:
- Great team work/collaboration.
- Implementing new concepts such as delegation, cross class interaction, and updating the DOM versus data model.

# Challenges:
- We ran into some challenges due to including both classes in the same file. We took time  to refactor this and put the classes on their own file. This made fixing any bugs and adding functionality much easier.
- We found ourselves tired from staring at screens from time to time. To resolve this, we utilized the Pomodoro technique and checked in verbally with each other to see if we needed a break or some solo work time.
